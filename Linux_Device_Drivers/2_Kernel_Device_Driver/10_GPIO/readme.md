# GPIO's in Raspberry-Pi
#### 1. LED ON/OFF using User Application [GO](../10_GPIO/01_LED_IOCTL_DRIVER/)
        1. Create a Char Device Driver 
        2. Implement Ioctl functionality and change the state (ON/OFF) of LED (GPIO 21) using user application. 
#### 2. LED with Timer [GO](../10_GPIO/02_LED_PERIODIC_TIMER_DRIVER/)
        1. Create a Char Device Driver 
        2. Use Timer and change the state (ON/OFF) of LED (GPIO 21) periodically using Timer. 
#### 3. Get Led Blinking Period by User Application [GO](../10_GPIO/03_LED_TIMER_IOCTL/)
        1. Create a Char Device Driver 
        2. Implement Ioctl functionality and change the blinking period of LED (GPIO 21) by receiving command from user application.
