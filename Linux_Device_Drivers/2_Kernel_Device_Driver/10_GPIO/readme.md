# Kernel Module
#### 1. Create a Char Device Driver with ioctl functionality and change the state (ON/OFF) of LED (GPIO 21) using user application. [GO](../2_Kernel_Device_Driver/10_GPIO/01_LED_IOCTL_DRIVER/)
#### 2. Create a Char Device Driver with timer implementation and change the state (ON/OFF) of LED (GPIO 21) periodically using Timer. [GO](../2_Kernel_Device_Driver/10_GPIO/02_LED_PERIODIC_TIMER_DRIVER/)
#### 3. Create a Char Device Driver with ioctl functionlity and timers and change the blinking time of LED (GPIO 21) by receiving command from user application. [GO](../2_Kernel_Device_Driver/10_GPIO/03_LED_TIMER_IOCTL/)
