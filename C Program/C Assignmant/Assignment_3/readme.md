## C Programming Assignment List
### Operators and Operands

### Basic Data Types
1. Develop a C program to calculate simple interest using the formula I=PTR/100. Display
Interest with two digit precision after decimal point
### Control Sequence
1. Develop a C program having following logic. If i is 20 or j is 20, display as “Atleast one
variable is having 20” otherwise display “Both variables are not having 20”. If i is less than
or equal to 40 and j is less than or equal to 40, It should display “Both are less than or equal
to 40” otherwise, it should display as “Both are not less than or equal to 40”. Implement this
using if-else statement as well as with conditional operator.
2. Develop a C program which accepts character type data items from users. In case if user
typed
‘A’ or ‘a’, it should display A for Apple
‘B’ or ‘b’, it should display B for Bat
‘D’ or ‘d’, it should display D for Dog
‘F’ or ‘f’, it should display F for Fan
Instead of the above 4 characters, if a user types any other character, it should display
“Character is not in the range”. Implement this using if-else statement and switch
statement.

by 5. Implement this using for loop and continue statement.
