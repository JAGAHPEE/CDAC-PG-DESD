# Assignment 1
1. Develop a C program to perform operations (+,*,-, / and %) on two whole 
numbers. Identify suitable data types to represent the numbers and 
resultant values
2. Develop a C program to add two operands and store the result in one of 
the operand using addition assignment operator.
3. Write a C program to find the maximum of 2 numbers using Conditional 
operator.
4. A C program contains the following declarations and initial assignments: 
int i= 8, j = 5; 
float x = 0.005, y = 0.01; 
char c = ‘c’, d = ‘d’; 
Determine the value of each of the following expressions. 
▪ (3*i*j)%(2*d) 
▪ (i*j)%(c+2*d) / (x*y) 
▪ 5 * (i + j) > 'c' 
▪ 2*x+ (y== 0) 
▪ (x > y) && (i > 0) || (j < 5) 
5. Write a program to find the area and the perimeter of a circle. 
 Take radius “r” as input.
6. Develop a C program to calculate simple interest using the formula 
I=PTR/100. Display Interest with two digit precision after decimal point
