# Control Sequence
1. Develop a C program having following logic. If i is 20 or j is 20, display as “Atleast one
variable is having 20” otherwise display “Both variables are not having 20”. If i is less than
or equal to 40 and j is less than or equal to 40, It should display “Both are less than or equal
to 40” otherwise, it should display as “Both are not less than or equal to 40”. Implement this
using if-else statement as well as with conditional operator.
2. Develop a C program which accepts character type data items from users. In case if user
typed
‘A’ or ‘a’, it should display A for Apple
‘B’ or ‘b’, it should display B for Bat
‘D’ or ‘d’, it should display D for Dog
‘F’ or ‘f’, it should display F for Fan
Instead of the above 4 characters, if a user types any other character, it should display
“Character is not in the range”. Implement this using if-else statement and switch
statement.
3. Develop a C program which adds all numbers from 1 to N, except those which are divisible
by 5. Implement this using for loop and continue statement.
4. Develop a C program to find factorial of a number N using for loop.
5. Develop a C program to find the sum of all odd numbers upto N using a while loop.
6. Write a program to print ASCII values of upper case and lower case alphabets and digits
(A-Z, a-z and 0-9).
7. Write a Program to find if a given number is Armstrong number.
Hint: (153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3)
8. Write a program to find whether the given number is palindrome or not.Palindrome is a
number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Example 16461
9. Write a menu based C program to perform operations (+, - and *) on matrices.
10. Generate the following pyramid of numbers using nested loops
1
212
32123
4321234
543212345
11. Write a program to search for an element in a given list of elements. Use break statement.
12. Write a program to print all the prime numbers in the first N numbers.
13. Write a program to find the sum of digits of a given number.
14. Write a C program to generate two Relatively Prime numbers. Two integers are relatively
prime (or coprime) if there is no integer greater than one that divides them both (that is,
their greatest common divisor is one). For example, 12 and 13 are relatively prime, but 12
and 14 are not.
15. Write a program to generate Random number
● Any
● Prime number
● Two Relatively Prime Numbers
