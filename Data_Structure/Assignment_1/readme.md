# Data Structures using C
## Assignment I
Note: Source code has to be thoroughly documented <br>
1. Given a matrix A of size m x n, write a function that returns the sum of elements below
the main diagonal, i.e those elements aij for which i>j <br>
2. Create a linked list ADT with functions for insertion, deletion, traverse forward, traverse
reverse, searching for an element, reversing a list and also test the above functionality. <br>
3. Develop a program to add two polynomials using linked list implementation for
polynomials <br>
4. Given two sorted lists, L1 and L2, write a procedure to merge L1 and L2 and generate a
third list <br>
5. Develop a self-adjusting list using linked list. A self-adjusting list is like a regular list,
except that all insertions are performed at the front, and when an element is accessed by
the Find, it is moved to the front of the list <br>
6. Implement doubly linked list ADT <br>
7. Create a Stack ADT using array implementation and solve the following 
   1. Balancing symbols
   2. Evaluation of postfix expression
   3. Converting Infix to postfix
8. Create a Stack ADT using linked list implementation <br>
9. Implement Linear Queue ADT using linked list implementation <br>
10. Implement Circular Queue ADT using array implementation <br>
11. Implement Deque ADT using doubly inked list. Deque is a data structure in which
insertions and deletions are performed only at the ends. <br>
